# 2d-Raycasting
A basic implementation of 2d raycasting. It uses pygame and has raycasting which can detect walls and will therefore create shadows. It was a project which I did in a weekend because I was interested in how rendering of shadows work in games and saw that this was one of the more complex yet simple to demonstrate implementations
